# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This prework study guide is a starting point for the UW coding bootcamp. It was created in order to help track all the information one should learn before the bootcamp has begun, and as a place to refer to topics covered before the course began. By creating this webpage, not only does one work on the concepts covered in the prework, but the webpage itself is a convenient tool for brushing up on some beginner topics.

## Installation

No Installation is needed to view and use this webpage.

## Usage

Each section contains notes about various topics related to 101 web development. Furthermore, if one opens the DevTools console, there is some basic JavaSript at work which will randomly chose a topic to study.

## Credits

This project was designed by the UW fullstack bootcamp and was fully implemented by me.
